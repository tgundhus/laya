    `predict()` accepts a str, a dict, or a list of conversation turns. A dict is
    serialised with `json.dumps(state, ensure_ascii=False)` and the resulting JSON text
    becomes the state the model reads.

    That is the whole trick -- there is no schema engine and no field lookup. Laya reads
    the serialised record as text, so the keys, values and wording all shape the answer,
    and deeply nested or ambiguous fields are harder for it than a flat status string.
    This record keeps the customer nested and the order statuses explicit, and the
    questions below land on the right side of a 0.5 threshold.
