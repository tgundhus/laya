    `router.predict()` is `route()` followed by one forward pass on the checkpoint the
    router picked. Nothing about the question schema changes between languages, and the
    result carries a `routing` block recording why the checkpoint was chosen.

    The same duplicate-charge complaint arrives in English, Hindi and German. English is
    read by `laya`; the other two are read by `laya-multilingual`. Watch `router.loaded`:
    the router builds the multilingual checkpoint only when the Hindi ticket shows up.
