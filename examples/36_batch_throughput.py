"""Example 36 -- throughput: one forward pass per call, many questions per call.

`predict(state, questions)` runs every question for one state in a single batched forward pass.
This example measures the same typed answers on the multilingual checkpoint two ways -- one
question per call, then a three-question set per call -- to show where the throughput comes from.

banner("36", "Batch throughput", """
    One `predict()` call is one state plus its questions, and those questions become the rows of
    a single batched forward pass. There is no batch-of-states argument: `collate_items` wraps
    the question list of *one* state in a single group. So the way to raise throughput is to ask
    more questions per call, not to queue more states into one call.

    Each question is its own row and repeats the state, so the win is not a shared encoding --
    it is one set of kernel launches and a fuller matrix instead of many tiny calls. Phase A
    answers 90 questions in 90 calls; phase B answers the *same* 90 questions in 30 calls.

    The 30 load-test tickets use four distinct bodies (with distinct ids) so the numbers are not
    dominated by MPS compiling a fresh kernel for every new sequence shape; a real deployment
    pays that once per shape and then amortises it, exactly as measured here.
