    `router_questions()` scores an arbitrary request on four axes -- difficulty (0-3),
    domain, whether it needs tools, and whether it is sensitive -- so a model gateway can
    pick a cheap or an expensive model per request instead of sending everything to the
    frontier.

    The three requests are chosen to land in different buckets. After the predictions we
    turn the answers into a small policy function and print the tier each request takes.
