"""Example 08 -- a calibrated yes/no with a noul question.

`noul` is a two-option question that returns P(true) directly. The probability is
calibrated, so the decision rule is yours: pick the threshold your application can
afford, rather than accepting a built-in 0.5.

banner("08", "Calibrated yes/no (noul)", """
    A `noul` question answers one statement with a probability instead of a label.
    The answer has `noul` -- P(true), in 0..1, the probability the statement holds --
    and `confidence`, which is max(p, 1-p) by the model's design.

    Note that `confidence` says nothing about which side won -- it is symmetric. The
    `noul` value is what carries the direction, so read it directly and apply your own
    threshold. A support queue might act at 0.9, while a cheap pre-filter might act at
    0.5; both are legitimate uses of the same calibrated number.

    The two states below are a clear yes and a clear no. Watch the probability sit near
    the ends of the range, and watch confidence mirror it around 0.5 only when the
    answer is genuinely uncertain.
