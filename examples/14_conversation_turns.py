`state` may be a list of `{"role", "content"}` turns instead of a single document, so

    A list of turns is serialised to JSON and becomes the state, exactly like a dict.
    That means the model sees the whole exchange, not just the last message, and
    questions can be about the arc of the conversation.

    Two exchanges are compared below. One is a calm tracking question that support
    resolves; the other is the same issue after two failed contacts, ending in a refund
    demand and a threat to cancel. `describe()` prints the four questions for each.

   The calm exchange reads as not upset, no refund and no cancellation risk, with the

   noul and pushes the score to about 2, between "clearly frustrated" and "angry".
