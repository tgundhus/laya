"""Example 16 -- many questions, still one forward pass.

Batching 13 independent questions into one `predict()` call costs one pass over the
state. The encoder sees the state once per question in the batch, and the answers all
come back together, so `usage["input_tokens"]` is the sum across the whole call.

banner("16", "Thirteen questions, one call", """
    Real triage asks many things about one message. Here 13 questions -- 5 choice,
    3 score and 5 noul -- are answered in a single `predict()` call.

    Two details worth noticing:

      * `usage["input_tokens"]` is the batch total. Split the questions across two
        calls and the per-call token counts add up to exactly the same number; the
        batch simply folds them into one pass.
      * latency barely moves with the number of questions. The encoder is the cost, and
        it runs once for the whole batch, not once per question.
