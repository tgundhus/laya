technical question, so the contrast between flagged and clean input is visible.

    `guard_questions()` is a real-time filter for text on its way into an LLM: five
    questions, one forward pass, no generation. The first two prompts are attacks and the
    third is ordinary -- watch the binary flags separate them cleanly.

    `harm_severity` is an ordinal rubric whose floor is "none", but in practice a benign
    request still scores around 1, so read it as a relative signal, not an absolute one.
