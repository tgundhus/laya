"""Example 06 -- an ordinal rubric with a score question.

A `score` question is a choice question whose labels are ordered. Laya returns an
expected level, the full distribution over levels, and the legend that maps each level
index back to its text, so the number never floats free of its rubric.

    A `score` question asks for an ordering, not a category. `criteria` is an ordered
    list from lowest to highest, and the answer reports `score` (the expected level,
    sum(level * probability), 0-based, so a value between levels is normal and
    meaningful), `probabilities` over every level keyed "0", "1", ..., `legend` (the
    criteria list in words), and `confidence`, the normalised entropy of the
    distribution, exactly as for choice.

    The same question is asked about a relaxed request and an outage. The expected
    level moves from below 1 to near 2, and the distribution sharpens.
