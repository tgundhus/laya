/**
 * Composing, dispatching and bounding hooks — the parts of {@code laya.hooks} that are not a type.
 *
 * <p>Three things here are contracts rather than implementation details, and each is pinned by
 * {@code fixtures/hooks.json}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Order.</b> {@link #compose} is process-wide defaults, then the hooks installed on the
 *       agent, then the per-call ones; {@link #dispatch} calls them in that order. A port that
 *       composes the other way round still runs every hook and fails nothing — except that the
 *       tracer a caller installed to watch what their per-call hook did now runs first and sees
 *       nothing.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link PredictContext#skip} does not stop the chain.</b> It assigns the results; it is
 *       {@link #around} reading them afterwards that skips inference. Every later start hook
 *       still runs, and can overwrite the answer.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link Policy#raiseErrors}.</b> True fails the request at the first throwing hook and
 *       the rest of the chain never runs. False reports and continues, which is what a telemetry
 *       hook needs — it must not be able to fail a request.</li>

     * <p>A timed-out hook KEEPS RUNNING. Neither Java nor Python can interrupt a thread that
     * will not cooperate, so what the deadline bounds is THE WAIT — not the request, and not the
     * process. The distinction is not pedantry and an earlier version of this paragraph had it
     * wrong. The abandoned thread still holds the live, mutable {@link PredictContext} of a call
     * that has moved on without it, and it can still write to it: measured over 60 identical
     * calls with a hook that overran a 50&nbsp;ms deadline and then assigned results, the late
     * write was accepted 60 times out of 60 and {@code ctx.usage} ended up describing a
     * different answer from {@code ctx.results} in 60 of them — because {@link #around} had
     * already totalled the usage of the answer it saw. In the runs where the write landed inside
     * the handful of microseconds before {@code around} read the results back, the CALLER was
     * handed the abandoned hook's answer instead. That is the reference's hazard too — it has
     * the same abandoned thread and the same shared dataclass.
     *
     * <p>What this port does about it, and the reference cannot easily: the thread is MARKED as
     * abandoned the moment its deadline expires, and {@link PredictContext} refuses a write from
     * a thread that carries that mark: the same 60 calls then disagree 0 times. See
     * {@link PredictContext#states(List)} for the one window it does not close. A hook that
     * blocks forever still leaks a thread per call, which is why the timeout is opt-in.
     *
     * <p>{@code raiseErrors} governs a {@link RuntimeException} and nothing else. An
     * {@link Error} is rethrown whatever the policy says, which is the reference's rule in Java
     * terms: it catches {@code Exception} and deliberately not {@code BaseException}, so a
     * {@code KeyboardInterrupt} or a {@code SystemExit} is never swallowed by a telemetry hook.
     * An {@link OutOfMemoryError} reported as a line of text and then carried on from is the
     * same mistake.
