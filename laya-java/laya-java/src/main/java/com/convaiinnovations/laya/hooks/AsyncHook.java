/**
 * Runs another hook's callbacks on an {@link Executor}, and waits for each one.
 *
 * <p>For a hook that must run on a particular thread -- a framework request scope, a single-threaded
 * actor, a UI loop -- not for making a slow hook free. The reference does the same: an async hook's
 * coroutine is driven to completion on a background loop ({@code laya/hooks.run_coroutine_sync}), so
 * the prediction still waits for it.
 *
 * <p>Waiting is what keeps a thrown exception reaching the hook policy, and keeps the mutable
 * {@link PredictContext} from being read after the call moved on.
 *
 * <p>Except on a deadline. {@code CompletableFuture.cancel} does not interrupt a task already
 * running on an executor, so an overrunning callback keeps going. It is {@link
 * PredictContext#abandon abandoned} instead, as {@link Hooks} does for a hook that overruns
 * {@code hooks_timeout}: anything it writes to the context afterwards is refused. Unlike that
 * case the executor's thread is reused, so the abandonment ends when the overrunning task
 * returns, and a later callback of the same call on that thread is accepted; an abandonment
 * made by anything else on that thread stays in force. A callback that had not started when the
 * caller stopped waiting -- on the deadline, or on an interrupt while it waited for one -- never
 * runs. Without a deadline the wait ignores interrupts, so it always ends with the callback. An
 * abandoned callback still occupies the executor's thread until it returns, so a single-threaded
 * executor has none left for the next callback -- size the executor for the deadline, or leave
 * the deadline off.
