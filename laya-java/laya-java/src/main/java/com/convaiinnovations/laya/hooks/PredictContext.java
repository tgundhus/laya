/**
 * One call, as every hook of that call sees it — and as a hook may change it.
 *
 * <p>Mutable, which nothing else in this port is. That is the point: a hook that could only read
 * would be a logger, and the reference's contract is that a start hook may rewrite the states,
 * the questions and the token budget, and that an end hook may rewrite the results. A record
 * cannot express any of that.
 *
 * <p>One context exists per call and is shared by every event of it, so {@link #runId} is what
 * lets a tracer pair a start with its end without threading state of its own. Identity is
 * identity: the reference declares {@code eq=False} so two contexts are never equal and one can
 * sit in a set keyed by the call rather than by its contents, which is what a Java object does
 * by default — so there is no {@code equals} or {@code hashCode} here, on purpose.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe, and not meant to be: hooks run in order, on the calling thread or, for an
 * {@link AsyncHook}, on its executor while the caller waits. The exception is a hook that
 * overruns a {@link Hooks.Policy#timeout} or an {@code AsyncHook} deadline, which keeps running
 * after its deadline expires while the call moves on without it — see {@link #states(List)} for
 * what this class does about that and what it cannot do.
 *
 * <p>Two of the reference's fields are absent. {@code router} and {@code decision} carry a
 * {@code RouteDecision} to an {@code on_route} hook. {@link com.convaiinnovations.laya.Router}
 * dispatches {@code on_route} with the chosen checkpoint in {@link #model()} and no states,
 * questions or decision, so a hook here observes the route but cannot replace it, which the
 * reference allows. What the reference splits across {@code agent} and {@code router} is one field
 * here, {@link #predictor}, because both are a {@link Predictor}.

     *
     * <p>Why it exists: a hook that overruns its deadline is abandoned, not stopped — neither
     * runtime can interrupt a thread that will not cooperate — and it is still holding this
     * object while the call carries on without it. Measured on this port before the guard, over
     * 60 calls whose start hook overran a 50&nbsp;ms deadline by 30&nbsp;ms and then assigned
     * results: 60 of 60 late writes were accepted, and {@code usage} then described a different
     * answer from {@code results} in 60 of 60, because {@link Hooks#around} had already totalled
     * the usage of the answer it saw. With the guard, the same 60 calls refuse 60 of 60 and
     * disagree 0 times. The reference has the identical hazard, so this is the port being
     * stricter rather than the port being different for its own sake.
     *
     * <p>What it does NOT fix: a write already PAST this check when the deadline expires still
     * lands. Measured on the same harness with the overrun cut to 1–5&nbsp;ms, so that the write
     * and the deadline collide: 2 to 17 of 60 late writes were still accepted. The window shrinks
     * from "the whole remainder of the call" to "the few instructions between the check and the
     * store", which is a narrowing, not a proof — and the guard is cheap enough to be worth the
     * narrowing on its own.
