package com.convaiinnovations.laya.hooks;

/**
 * The one place a caller's own code runs inside a prediction.
 *
 * <p>Override only the events you need; the rest are no-ops. A hook may watch a call, rewrite
 * what it is about to ask, or answer it outright with {@link PredictContext#skip}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final class Tracer implements Hook {
 *     @Override public void onPredictEnd(PredictContext ctx) {
 *         span.record(ctx.usage().inputTokens(), ctx.elapsedMs());
 *     }
 * }
 * agent.hooks().addHook(new Tracer());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This is ONE type where the reference has two. {@code laya.hooks.Hook} is a structural
 * {@code Protocol} — a hook is anything with at least one of the six methods — and
 * {@code BaseHook} is the concrete no-op class to subclass when you would rather not implement
 * by shape. An interface with default methods is both at once, so there is nothing for a second
 * type to be. The consequence is that the reference's "missing methods are skipped" becomes "the
 * default does nothing", which is the same behaviour from the outside: {@link Hooks#dispatch}
 * calling a default no-op and the reference finding no attribute to call both leave the context
 * untouched and nothing in the log.
 *
 * <p>{@link AsyncHook} runs a hook on an {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} and waits for it,
 * for a callback that must run on a particular thread. It is not a way to make a slow hook
 * free: the prediction still waits, as the reference's does.
 * <p>{@code AsyncHook} requires concurrent dispatch. A serialized registry refuses it before
 * the callback runs, because a callback on another thread cannot re-enter the registry's lock.
 *
 * <p>A hook runs on the calling thread, on the thread a {@link Hooks.Policy#timeout()} runs it
 * on, or on an {@code AsyncHook}'s executor, and in each case the caller waits for it until a
 * deadline expires -- so until it overruns, it is as thread-safe as the call around it. Install
 * one that is not, and set {@link HookRegistry#concurrent(boolean)} to false to have dispatch
 * serialise it.
