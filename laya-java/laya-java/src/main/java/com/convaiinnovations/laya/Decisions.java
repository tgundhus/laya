/**
 * Schema-driven decisions: a JSON schema becomes Laya questions, and the answers come back as
 * the schema's own values.
 *
 * <p>The mapping is a documented subset, not a JSON-schema implementation: an object of
 * properties, each one an enum choice, a boolean, or a bounded integer scale. Anything that
 * cannot be answered from a fixed option set — a free string, an array, a nested object — is
 * refused with a {@link SchemaException} that names the path, because a caller holding a
 * 32-property schema cannot act on "this schema is not supported".
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Map<String, Object> schema = (Map<String, Object>) Json.parse("""
 *     {"type": "object", "properties": {
 *        "department": {"enum": ["billing", "support", "sales"]},
 *        "urgency":    {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 5},
 *        "needs_human":{"type": "boolean"}}}""");
 * Map<String, Object> values = Decisions.decide(agent, ticket, schema).values();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Four rules a port gets wrong by default</b>, each pinned by
 * {@code fixtures/structured.json}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@code choice} projects to the schema <b>value</b>, not the label the model answered
 *       with. For {@code enum: ["billing", "support"]} the two coincide; for
 *       {@code enum: [10, 20, 30]} a port returning the label hands back the string
 *       {@code "20"} where the schema says the integer {@code 20}.</li>
 *   <li>A {@code score} is {@code minimum + argmax(probabilities)}. The answer's own
 *       {@code score} field is the probability-weighted <b>level index</b>, not a field value, so
 *       the no-probabilities fallback rounds it and adds {@code minimum} once. Subtracting
 *       {@code minimum} first and adding it back cancels out and silently drops it from every
 *       scale that does not start at zero. The rounding is Python's, half to <b>even</b>;
 *       {@code Math.round} is half up and disagrees at every {@code k + 0.5}.</li>
 *   <li>A {@code noul} is {@code >= 0.5}, so exactly {@code 0.5} is <b>true</b>.</li>
 *   <li>A low-confidence answer projects to <b>null</b>; an answer that is <b>absent</b> leaves
 *       the field out of the map entirely. "not believed" and "not asked" are different
 *       outcomes, and a caller that cannot tell them apart reports a decision nobody made.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Where this differs from the reference, deliberately.</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Only the JSON-schema path is ported. There is no pydantic on the JVM, and the reference's
 *       {@code questions_from_pydantic} / {@code answer_to_pydantic} are a model-to-schema step in
 *       front of exactly this code. Mapping Java records would be a new design, not a port.</li>
 *   <li>{@code return_details} is gone: {@link #decide} always returns a {@link Decision}, whose
 *       {@link Decision#values()} is what the plain form returned. One return type instead of two
 *       selected by a boolean.</li>
 *   <li>The reference forwards {@code min_confidence} down to {@code runner.predict} and falls
 *       back to gating the result itself when the runner does not take the keyword. Here there is
 *       no such keyword on {@link Predictor}, so the second path is the only path — which is also
 *       the one the reference's own {@code decide_batch} always takes.</li>
 *   <li>{@code routing} is not reported. {@link Prediction} carries no routing block, so there is
 *       nothing to pass through; {@link Router} reports its decision at the point it makes it.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>batched</b> decision cannot route per state. The reference's {@code decide_batch}
 *       special-cases a {@code route_batch}-capable runner and sends one request per state "so
 *       states may route to different checkpoints"; {@link Router} here implements
 *       {@link Predictor} and not {@link BatchPredictor}, so {@link #decideBatch} will not take
 *       one at all. Batching a router means deciding what a shared forward pass over two
 *       checkpoints is, which is a design question and not a port.</li>
 *   <li>An {@code enum} must be an <b>array</b>. The reference measures and iterates whatever
 *       is there, so {@code "enum": "abc"} becomes a three-option choice over {@code "a"},
 *       {@code "b"}, {@code "c"} — a schema nobody wrote, built from a typo — and
 *       {@code "enum": 5} is a {@code TypeError} from inside {@code len()} rather than a
 *       refusal naming the property.</li>
 *   <li>A score's {@code minimum} and {@code maximum} must be integers, and a <b>boolean</b> is
 *       not one. Python's {@code bool} subclasses {@code int}, so the reference accepts
 *       {@code {"minimum": false, "maximum": true}} and asks "Score {@code x} from 0 to 1".</li>
 *   <li>A {@code description} must be a <b>string</b>. The reference puts whatever is there into
 *       the question's {@code instructions} — {@code 5}, or {@code ['a']} — which is not text a
 *       model can be asked.</li>
 *   <li>A {@code score} answer whose {@code score} is not finite is refused. CPython's
 *       {@code int()} refuses it too — {@code ValueError} for a NaN, {@code OverflowError} for
 *       an infinity — so the verdict matches and only the wording differs: this one names the
 *       field, as the rest of the answer-shape refusals do.</li>
 *   <li>An {@code anyOf}/{@code oneOf} that is neither falsy nor iterable — a number, or
 *       {@code true} — is a {@link SchemaException} naming the key, where the reference raises
 *       {@code TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable} from inside its own comprehension. The
 *       truthiness itself is reproduced: a falsy {@code anyOf} falls through to {@code oneOf}
 *       and a truthy non-array reaches the same "got 0" refusal the reference raises. This is
 *       the <b>one</b> exception to the rule that a refusal message matches character for
 *       character.</li>
 *   <li>A top level that is not an object is a <b>compile error</b>, not a refusal:
 *       {@link #plan} takes a {@link Map}, where the reference raises
 *       {@code expected a JSON schema object, got list}. A caller who reaches it through an
 *       unchecked cast — {@code (Map<String, Object>) Json.parse(text)}, which is the README's
 *       own idiom — gets a {@link ClassCastException} from the cast instead. The one case the
 *       static type does not cover, a null schema, is refused with the reference's message.</li>
 * </ul>
