     * record what inference was actually handed, a budget check run after the chain to catch a
     * hook that added options the windows were not sized for, and two separate reporting paths
     * for a hook that answered the document outright and one that rewrote the states it was
     * scanned over. Without those, a hook that adds one option silently re-truncates every
     * window — the tail of each reaches no model while the reported span says it did — and a
     * hook that answers the call leaves {@code windows} claiming a scan that never happened.
     *
     * <p>Running hooks here without that machinery would be worse than not running them, so
     * this does not. Nothing is silently dropped: {@link #predictBatch} takes a {@link HookCall},
