"""Decision consistency: how close an answer is to flipping, and a cache that replays decisions.

A Laya forward pass samples nothing, so the same request on the same checkpoint and hardware gets
the same answer, byte for byte. A decision can still move with what surrounds the pass: other
hardware or precision, a new checkpoint revision or calibration, or a request that differs in a
detail. Two tools cover that:

* `decision_margins` reads a result and says how far each answer sits from its decision boundary.
  It needs only the payload, so it reads the same schema from a Jev-compatible API as well.
* `DecisionCache` is a prediction hook that stores each decision under a hash of the request and
  the model that answered it, and replays it when the same request comes again. It keeps them in
  memory or in a SQLite file, or in any `DecisionStore`, which is how several machines can share
  one set of decisions.

All of it is plain Python: importing this module must not pull in torch.

    For `choice` and `score` answers the margin is the probability gap between the two most likely

    acts on, capped at 1; at the default threshold of 0.5 that is the gap between P(yes) and P(no),

    A small margin means a small change can flip the answer: another run of a model whose output
    varies between runs, other hardware or precision, a reworded request or a recalibration. The

class DecisionCache:
    """A prediction hook that replays the decision a request got the first time.

    Install it on a `Router`, where it keys on the routed checkpoint and on the language the
    request is scored in, or on an `Agent` or `ONNXAgent`:

        from laya import DecisionCache, Router

        cache = DecisionCache("decisions.sqlite", ttl=30 * 24 * 3600, renew_on_hit=True)
        router = Router(hooks=[cache])

    Before inference it looks every state up. A state that hits skips the forward pass; the rest
    run as usual. After inference it stores what the model returned. The first decision stored
    for a request wins: a request that missed at the same time, in another thread, process or
    machine sharing the store, returns the stored decision instead of its own, so every caller
    gets one answer per request while the entry lives.

    Within one process, a request that misses while another thread is already computing it waits
    for that decision instead of running the model again (`coalesce`), and a state repeated
    within one call is computed once. A request never waits on itself: not for the other states
    of its own batch, not under `hooks_concurrent=False` and not under `hooks_timeout`.

    A replay is the stored payload exactly, `usage` included; a `Router` adds the current
    `routing` to it.

    The cache never fails a prediction. When its store raises (a locked or full SQLite file, a
    shared store that cannot be reached) or holds a value that cannot be decoded, the request
    goes on as if there were no cache: it is computed and, where the store cannot take it, not
    kept. The first failure warns, and `cache_info()["errors"]` counts them all.

    The key is a 16-byte BLAKE2b hash of the state, the questions in their given order (option
    order is positional), the per-call token budget, the checkpoint and the model's fingerprint,
    plus the routing decision when the checkpoint has per-language temperatures, the one way
    the language reaches an answer. Values are compact JSON, compressed when that is smaller;
    nothing of the request text is stored.

    Each decision carries its own expiry. `ttl` sets it: a number of seconds, None for never, or
    a function `ttl(questions, result)` that returns either -- or 0 to keep that decision not at
    all -- so a question set or an answer can have its own retention. With `renew_on_hit`, a
    replay pushes the expiry out again, so a decision lasts as long as its request keeps coming;
    the renewal is written at most 16 times per lifetime. Otherwise a hit writes nothing. The
    built-in stores drop expired decisions and, past `maxsize`, the least recently stored or
    renewed ones.

    An `Agent` call may pass `lang`, which a hook cannot see. On an `Agent` with per-language
    temperatures the cache therefore stands aside rather than risk replaying an answer scored for
    another language; install it on the `Router` there.

    Args:
        path: SQLite file that keeps decisions across restarts and shares them between processes.
            `None` keeps them in this process's memory, unless `store` is given.
        ttl: Seconds a decision is replayed, None for no expiry, or a function of
            `(questions, result)` returning seconds, None, or 0 to not keep that decision. It must
            not change `result`.
        maxsize: Most decisions the built-in stores hold; `None` for no bound. With a `path`, the
            bound is enforced every `min(1000, maxsize // 10)` stores. A custom `store` bounds
            itself.
        fingerprint: The model's part of the key. `None` derives it from the checkpoint id,
            revision, calibration temperatures, token budget and Laya version, so a change to any
            of them starts a fresh set of decisions. A fixed string keeps replaying decisions
            across such changes until they expire.
        renew_on_hit: Count a decision's lifetime from its last replay instead of from when it
            was stored.
        store: A `DecisionStore` to keep decisions in instead of memory or `path`, for instance
            one shared by several machines.
        coalesce: Let a request that misses wait for another thread of this process already
            computing it, so concurrent identical requests share one forward pass. False computes
            each one and lets the first decision stored win.
