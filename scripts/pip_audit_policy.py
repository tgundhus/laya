"""Decide whether pip-audit's reports pass: the dependency audit's policy, in one place.

pip-audit fails on every advisory it finds. A few have no fixed release anywhere and cannot be
reached through Laya-Pro -- a hole in a server this package never starts, in a package only an
optional integration pulls in -- and a check that is red for those is red for everything, so it
stops being read. This script reads pip-audit's JSON reports and fails on:

- an advisory that is not in the accepted list,
- an accepted advisory once a fixed release exists: upgrade, or review the entry again,
- an entry accepted for one package that shows up on another, and
- a dependency pip-audit could not audit at all (what its --strict fails on).

An accepted advisory that is still unfixed passes with a warning, so it stays in sight. A report
passed with `--shipped` covers what the package and its image ship (the core plus `serve`): no
advisory there is ever accepted, whatever the list says. The list
lives in `.github/accepted-advisories.toml`; each entry needs an `id`, the `package` and a
`reason`, and may give `aliases` (CVE and GHSA ids) and where it comes from.

        --shipped shipped.json report.json ...
